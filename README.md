# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdul-Malik Zekri!

🎓 Senior @ University of South Florida (Computer Engineering + Applied Mathematics)  
🧠 Computational Neuroscience | 🧬 Biomedical AI | 🧠 Interpretable Machine Learning  
🚀 Goldwater Scholar | Break Through Tech AI Fellow | Research-driven Engineer

I'm passionate about understanding how structure enables function, whether in the brain or in machine learning models. My research spans biologically inspired neural circuit modeling, reinforcement learning, and medical image analysis. Currently, I’m developing input-output optimized spiking neural networks (SNNs) and working on interpretable models of predictive coding in artificial agents.

## ✨ Fun Fact  
When I’m not coding neural circuit simulations, I’m probably playing pickleball, powerlifting, or running.
