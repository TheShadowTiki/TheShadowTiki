I study how neural circuit structure gives rise to computation across both biological and artificial systems. My work spans biologically grounded spiking neural networks, reinforcement learning, and medical image analysis, with an emphasis on theory-guided, interpretable models.

My public software projects emphasize algorithmic geometry, graph theory, systems programming, and interactive simulation. These form the computational and mathematical foundation for my current work in neural circuit modeling, learning theory, and large-scale biological data analysis.

Currently, I am developing input–output optimized spiking neural networks (SNNs) and working on theoretical connections between predictive coding, minimum description length (MDL), and neuromodulation-inspired learning.

Outside the lab, I spend most of my time playing pickleball, powerlifting, running, or thinking about neural circuits during all three.
